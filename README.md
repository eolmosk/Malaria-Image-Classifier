# Malaria Clasifier
 
 This project presents a computer vision classification model designed to differentiate between uninfected and parasitized red blood cells, with the goal of providing a reliable, fast, and cost-effective means of diagnosing malaria. The model is capable of analyzing input images of red blood cells and accurately classifying them as either infected or uninfected. This project was developed as part of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Applied Data Science Program.
